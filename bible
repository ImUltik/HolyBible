5
The Unopened Book and the Lamb
And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book
written within and on the back side, sealed with seven seals.
And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is
worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof ?
And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was
able to open the book, neither to look thereon.
And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and
to read the book, neither to look thereon.
And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not : behold, the Lion of
the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the
book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.
¶ And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four
beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been
slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven
Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that
sat upon the throne.
And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and
twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them
harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints.
And they sung a new song, saying,
Thou art worthy to take the book,
and to open the seals thereof :
for thou wast slain,
and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood
out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation ;
and hast made us unto our God kings and priests :
and we shall reign on the earth.
And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the
throne, and the beasts, and the elders : and the number of them was
ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands ;

saying with a loud voice,
Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and
wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.
And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under
the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard
I saying,
Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth
upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.
And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell
down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.

The Seals
And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it
were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and
see.
And I saw, and behold a white horse : and he that sat on him had a
bow ; and a crown was given unto him : and he went forth
conquering, and to conquer.
¶ And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second
beast say, Come and see.
And there went out another horse that was red : and power was given
to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they
should kill one another : and there was given unto him a great
sword.
¶ And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast
say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse ; and he that
sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of
wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny ; and see
thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
¶ And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the
fourth beast say, Come and see.

2625 Revelation 6
And I looked, and behold a pale horse : and his name that sat on
him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given
unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and
with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.
¶ And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the
souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the
testimony which they held :
and they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy
and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that
dwell on the earth ?
And white robes were given unto every one of them ; and it was said
unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their
fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as
they were, should be fulfilled.
¶ And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there
was a great earthquake ; and the sun became black as sackcloth of
hair, and the moon became as blood ;
and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth
her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.
And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together ; and
every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men,
and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman,
and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of
the mountains ;
and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from
the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of
the Lamb :
for the great day of his wrath is come ; and who shall be able to
stand ?

2628 Revelation 8
And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the
saints, ascended up before God out of the angel’s hand.
And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar,
and cast it into the earth : and there were voices, and thunderings,
and lightnings, and an earthquake.
The Trumpets
¶ And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared
themselves to sound.
¶ The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled
with blood, and they were cast upon the earth : and the third part of
trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
¶ And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain
burning with fire was cast into the sea : and the third part of the sea
became blood ;
and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had
life, died ; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
¶ And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from
heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of
the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters ;
and the name of the star is called Wormwood : and the third part of
the waters became wormwood ; and many men died of the waters,
because they were made bitter.
¶ And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was
smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the
stars ; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone
not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.
¶ And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of
heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters
of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the
three angels, which are yet to sound !

And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto
the earth : and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.
And he opened the bottomless pit ; and there arose a smoke out of
the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace ; and the sun and the air
were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.
And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth : and unto
them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of
the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree ; but only those
men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.
And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that
they should be tormented five months : and their torment was as
the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.
And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it ; and
shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.
¶ And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto
battle ; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their
faces were as the faces of men.
And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the
teeth of lions.
And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron ; and the
sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses
running to battle.
And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in
their tails : and their power was to hurt men five months.
And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless
pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the
Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.
¶ One woe is past ; and, behold, there come two woes more
hereafter.
¶ And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four
horns of the golden altar which is before God,

The Seventh Trumpet
¶ And the seventh angel sounded ; and there were great voices in
heaven, saying,
The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord,
and of his Christ ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.
And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their
seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,
saying,
We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast,
and art to come ; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power,
and hast reigned.
And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of
the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give
reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them
that fear thy name, small and great ; and shouldest destroy them
which destroy the earth.
¶ And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen
in his temple the ark of his testament : and there were lightnings,
and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.
12
The Woman and the Dragon
And there appeared a great wonder in heaven ; a woman clothed
with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a
crown of twelve stars :
and she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be
delivered.
And there appeared another wonder in heaven ; and behold a great
red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns
upon his heads.
And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast
them to the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which

¶ And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed
are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth : Yea, saith the
Spirit, that they may rest from their labors ; and their works do
follow them.
The Harvest of the Earth
¶ And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one
sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown,
and in his hand a sharp sickle.
And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice
to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap : for the
time is come for thee to reap ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.
And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth ; and
the earth was reaped.
¶ And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he
also having a sharp sickle.
And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over
fire ; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle,
saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the
vine of the earth ; for her grapes are fully ripe.
And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the
vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of
God.
And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came
out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a
thousand and six hundred furlongs.
15
The Angels with the Last Plagues
And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven
angels having the seven last plagues ; for in them is filled up the
wrath of God.

¶ And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air ; and there
came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne,
saying, It is done.
And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings ; and there was
a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth,
so mighty an earthquake, and so great.
And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the
nations fell : and great Babylon came in remembrance before God,
to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone
about the weight of a talent : and men blasphemed God because of
the plague of the hail ; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.
17
The Judgment of the Great Harlot
And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials,
and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither ; I will show unto
thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many
waters ;
with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and
the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine
of her fornication.
So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness : and I saw a
woman sit upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy,
having seven heads and ten horns.
And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked
with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in
her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication :
and upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery, babylon
the great, the mother of harlots and abominations of
the earth.

standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that
great city Babylon, that mighty city ! for in one hour is thy
judgment come.
¶ And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her ;
for no man buyeth their merchandise any more :
the merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of
pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all
thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner
vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,
and cinnamon, and odors, and ointments, and frankincense, and
wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and
horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.
And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and
all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee,
and thou shalt find them no more at all.
The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall
stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,
and saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen,
and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones,
and pearls !
For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every
shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many
as trade by sea, stood afar off,
and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What
city is like unto this great city !
And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing,
saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that
had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness ! for in one hour is
she made desolate.
Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets ;
for God hath avenged you on her.
¶ And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and
cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city
Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.

and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee ; and the
voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at
all in thee : for thy merchants were the great men of the earth ; for
by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of
all that were slain upon the earth.

The Multitude in Heaven Praises God
And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in
heaven, saying,
Alleluia ; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord
our God :
for true and righteous are his judgments ; for he hath judged the
great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and
hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and
ever.
And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and
worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen ; Alleluia.
And a voice came out of the throne, saying,
Praise our God, all ye his servants,
and ye that fear him, both small and great.
And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the
voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings,
saying,
Alleluia : for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.
Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him : for the marriage
of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.

The Marriage Supper of the Lamb
¶ And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called
unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me,
These are the true sayings of God.
And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou
do it not : I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren that have the
testimony of Jesus : worship God : for the testimony of Jesus is the
spirit of prophecy.
The Rider on the White Horse
¶ And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse ; and he that
sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he
doth judge and make war.
His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns ;
and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.
And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood : and his name is
called The Word of God.
And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white
horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should
smite the nations ; and he shall rule them with a rod of iron : and he
treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty
God.
And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King
of Kings, and Lord of Lords.
¶ And I saw an angel standing in the sun ; and he cried with a loud
voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come
and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God ;
that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the
flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit

on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small
and great.
And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies,
gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse,
and against his army.
And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that
wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that
had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his
image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with
brimstone.
And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon
the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth : and all the
fowls were filled with their flesh.
20
The Thousand Years
And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the
bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the
Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal
upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the
thousand years should be fulfilled : and after that he must be loosed
a little season.
¶ And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was
given unto them : and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded
for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had
not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received
his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands ; and they lived and
reigned with Christ a thousand years.
But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years
were finished. This is the first resurrection.

¶ And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed
out of his prison,
and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four
quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to
battle : the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the
camp of the saints about, and the beloved city : and fire came down
from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and
brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be
tormented day and night for ever and ever.
The Judgment at the Great White Throne
¶ And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from
whose face the earth and the heaven fled away ; and there was
found no place for them.
And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God ; and the
books were opened : and another book was opened, which is the
book of life : and the dead were judged out of those things which
were written in the books, according to their works.
And the sea gave up the dead which were in it ; and death and hell
delivered up the dead which were in them : and they were judged
every man according to their works.
And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second
death.
And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast
into the lake of fire.

The New Heaven and the New Earth
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and
the first earth were passed away ; and there was no more sea.
And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from
God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and
they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be
their God.
And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes ; and there shall
be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be
any more pain : for the former things are passed away.
¶ And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things
new. And he said unto me, Write : for these words are true and
faithful.
And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the
beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the
fountain of the water of life freely.
He that overcometh shall inherit all things ; and I will be his God,
and he shall be my son.
But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and
murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all
liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and
brimstone : which is the second death.
The New Jerusalem
¶ And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the
seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me,
saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.

2650 Revelation 21
And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain,
and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out
of heaven from God,
having the glory of God : and her light was like unto a stone most
precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal ;
and had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates
twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of
the twelve tribes of the children of Israel :
on the east three gates ; on the north three gates ; on the south three
gates ; and on the west three gates.
And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the
names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
¶ And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city,
and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the
breadth : and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand
furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty and four
cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.
And the building of the wall of it was of jasper : and the city was pure
gold, like unto clear glass.
And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all
manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper ; the
second, sapphire ; the third, a chalcedony ; the fourth, an emerald ;
the fifth, sardonyx ; the sixth, sardius ; the seventh, chrysolite ; the
eighth, beryl ; the ninth, a topaz ; the tenth, a chrysoprasus ; the
eleventh, a jacinth ; the twelfth, an amethyst.
And the twelve gates were twelve pearls ; every several gate was of
one pearl : and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were
transparent glass.
¶ And I saw no temple therein : for the Lord God Almighty and the
Lamb are the temple of it.
And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine
in it : for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light
thereof.

And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day : for there shall be
no night there.
And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.
And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth,
neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie : but they
which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
22
And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,
proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was
there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded
her fruit every month : and the leaves of the tree were for the
healing of the nations.
And there shall be no more curse : but the throne of God and of the
Lamb shall be in it ; and his servants shall serve him :
and they shall see his face ; and his name shall be in their foreheads.
And there shall be no night there ; and they need no candle, neither
light of the sun ; for the Lord God giveth them light : and they shall
reign for ever and ever.
Jesus to Come Soon
¶ And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true : and the
Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show unto his
servants the things which must shortly be done.
Behold, I come quickly.
¶ Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this
book.
¶ And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had
heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel
which showed me these things.

book : for the time is at hand.
He that is unjust, let him be unjust still : and he which is filthy, let
him be filthy still : and he that is righteous, let him be righteous

¶ I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the
churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright
and morning star.
¶ And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth
say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will,

¶ For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the
prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God
shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book :
and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this
prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and
out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this
book.
¶ He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly :
Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
¶ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
